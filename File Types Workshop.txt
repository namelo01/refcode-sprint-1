Explanation
This workshop explores different file types as a way of showing that there are many ways to format a document, and HTML/CSS are just one way. It also provides the groundwork for understanding that handwritten code needs to be edited in plaintext, in a special editor (not MS Word) and given a special extension. HTML files can be opened by either a browser or an editor. The same exact document can be encoded in different formats.
